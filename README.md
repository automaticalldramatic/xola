## Build a web app that displays Xola experiences

### The requirements:

* The requirements are intentionally high level to give room for creativity
* The JSON data for the experiences can be found here: http://xola.com/experiences
* Use as many or as few fields from the JSON feed as you like to render the app
* The app must load the data from the API endpoint (you should not embed the JSON data into you app)
* The app must use backbone.js to hold the JSON data
* The app must be responsive -- web and mobile device
* The app need not have a landing page -- you can just start by displaying the first experience
* Show a preview of the next and previous experience -- the user should also be able to navigate to the next and previous experiences
